# Hasa Project
The Hasa Project is a space-themed website, I created it as an activity during a workshop which took place in march 2022, it includes a header with the logo and navigation bar, as well as a spaceman illustration and some description to what the fictional company envisions, a button which changes colors when being hovered for more information and a footer with copyright information.
